As ad administrator of a collaboration system in an international entreprise company I see my self working with many different tasks on a daily basis. Obviously only one of a time, but at the end of the day if could have been engagement in more that 10 projects.

So my problem has been to handle this constant context shift, having to remember where I was, where the last script I ran a few weeks a go is placed, and really hating not to be able to support my colleagues in a timely maner.

That is why I started looking for additional hands to support me. I started figuring out how it is to work as a chef in a fine restaurant. How the chef organizes the work, and how a chef is able to get support from less skilled labour to many tasks. That made me remind of the time where I worked at my daddys company, the natitional rail road company of Denmark, called DSB which at that time also was heavly involved in connecting the danish Islands with ships. I got a job in the kitchen on on of the ferries crossing from Aarhus to Kalundborg where I assisted in preparing a lot of diffente stuff. 

My job title was called "koksmat" - which translated into the english word "kitchen hand" in other words the assistant to a cook.

I then decided to make my own assistant, a digital kitchen hand called "koksmat" - you can learn more about that at learn.koksmat.com
